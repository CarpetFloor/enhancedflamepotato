Hot potatoe that is randomly given to player at start of round
After certain time it explodes (possibly eliminate one player at a time until only 1 player)
Can throw but if miss then lose (or maybe not), or can simply touch other player
Can dash, but a bit of a cooldown
Possibly abilities and items can randomly drop that can be used once or give a buff for a bit
Possibly have the map have obstacles, and possibly have obstacles change or move or something similar
