                Since so many people apparently wanted a tutorial to know how 
                to play the game, becuase apparently that is something they did 
                not know, here is the so-called "tutorial" that has now officially 
                been added to this game.

                Preface: Make sure to <b>PLAY IN LANDSCAPE MODE IF ON MOBILE</b> (that 
                is when your phone is longer horizontally than vertically). And yes, 
                there is no warning or checking for if in landscape mode, but that's 
                because it is kind of difficult to do and just telling people to play 
                in landscape mode is much easier. And yes, this probably is not actually 
                a preface, but that sounds cool.

                Goal: Make sure you don't have the potato (should be pretty obvious, 
                because there is literally a potato in the game. Plus, it's on fire) 
                when the time runs out. The time is shown the red bar in the top-center 
                of the screen. Whoever does have the potato when time runs out will be 
                eliminated and the next round will start with the remaining players until 
                one player wins.

                Controls
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>-MOVE</b>: WASD, or the arrow keys on computer. On mobile, use the joystick in the 
                bottom-left corner of the screen.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>-THROW POTATO</b>: Click the screen where you want the potato to go on a computer. 
                On mobile tap on the screen where you want the potato to be thrown. When 
                throwing the potato, it does not have infite range, but will go over half of 
                the map. Throwing the potato is the only way to give the potato to another 
                player. If you miss your throw when trying to hit another player (you 
                probably will) it will land on the ground and remain there until picked up. 
                The only player who can pick up the potato is the person who threw it. And if 
                <b>the potato is on the ground</b> when the time runs out, the player who thew 
                it and missed will still loose that round.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>-ABILITY</b>: Space bar on computer. On mobile, use the button in the bottom-right 
                corner of the screen.
