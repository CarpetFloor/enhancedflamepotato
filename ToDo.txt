SMALL GOALS:
-Make mobile friendly
-Fix player name being off-center


ADDITIONAL STUFF GOALS:
-Spectator mode
    >When player looses round, they are able to watch the rest of the game
    >Look different than when playing regularly
    >Allow player to exit to main menu
    >If watched through the entire game, spectator(s) sent back to lobby with players

-When game is over, send everyone (including spectators) back to lobby to allow playing again

-Character customization menu
    >Access from main menu or lobby
    >Where name change is
    >Where ability selection is
    >Where player type is
        -Can be faster but have a larger hitbox (and look bigger)
        -Can also be slower but have a smaller hitbox (and look smaller)

-Name change
    >Can change in lobby

-Potato hit player impact effect

-Make main menu look better
    >Add a flaming potato
    >Add other cool stuff

-More player skins

-More maps (only visual)

-Different abilities (all have same cooldown)
    >Can ony choose one ability
    >Defensive (for when player does not have the potato)
        -Dash (defualt abilility that original game had)
        -Undo moves
        -Invisibility (should be really short)
        -Shockwave (knock back everyone in a small radius around player)
    >Offensive (for when player has the potato)
        -Boomerang (if potato misses while active automatically go back to thrower)
        -Strong throw (potato throws travel faster and farther while active)
        -Big potato (potato throw is a hit from farther away while active)
        -Land mine (while active, when potato misses and is on the ground, if another 
            player moves near the potato at a radius that is larger than needed for 
            the throw, that player is given the potato)

-Randomly moving barriers
    >Ideas for how they work and what they are here (I have no idea yet)

-Powerups that randomly spawn (should last for a short time)
    >Super speed
    >Other powerups here

-Make all indentation of server.js 4
