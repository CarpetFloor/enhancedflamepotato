SMALL GOALS:
-Indicator that dash is ready (like colored border or something) (do this because the last bit
    of the cooldown is when the bar goes across the border, which is not visible. So when it
    looks like the dash is ready, you actually have to wait another like half of a second)
-Player animation
-Player points towards mouse
-Potato
-Next round
-Game ends
-Kick players when one player leaves
-Mobile controls


BIG GOALS:
-Custom CSV settings file to read and write from, and even allow in game to have different games
-More player characters
-More maps
-Can change name
-Spectator mode
-Randomly moving barriers
-Powerups that randomly spawn
