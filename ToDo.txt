SMALL GOALS:
-Name tags (don't make colored)
-Game ends
-Kick players when one player leaves
-Mobile controls
-Make sure the player that starts with potato is random (use commented line)


ADDITIONAL STUFF GOALS:
-Make all indentation of server.js 4
-Add flaming potato to main menu
-Potato burning effect (so it actually is a flame potato, kind of actually like what the 
    name of this game is)
-Potato hit player impact effect
-When game is over, send everyone (including spectators) back to lobby to allow playing again
-Possibly add an undo move ability (either have along with dash or choose dash or undo move),
    where the player can instantly undo the last like 3 moves (frames) they made. There would 
    be an effect like dash and an icon that recharges like dash, and recharge would be the same
    as dash. NOTE: all abilities should have the same cooldown adn shouldn't have too slow or 
    too long of a recharge. Basically, make it long enough so that it can't be spammed and so 
    that it should be used in a more tactical and thoughtful manner; but make it fast enough so
    that it can be used multiple times in the game rather than just like once or twice.
