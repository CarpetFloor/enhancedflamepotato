FROM SOURCE CODE

(!)==high priority

[==CSS==]

[==GAME==]
-Sometimes player input does not work properly when pressing buttons fast
-Sometimes player can end up past borders, but when moving at all, they get
    teleported back to the edge of the border(s), so maybe it isn't that
    much of an issue, except for the fact that they can throw potato from
    outside of the border, however that wouldn't give the player an advantage

[==MULTIPLAYER==]
-When another client has the potato, the potato is drawn underneath that client
(!)-Sometimes the potato ground text is drawn and keeps drawing at a player
