# Enhanced Flame Potato
Better networking version of [flamepotato](https://github.com/CarpetFloor/flamepotato). Also, more content will be added that is not in the original.
<br /><br />
Note that this exists to create a separate version of the changes that will be made to the original
source code to create to help create a different development environment. While branches could have 
been utillized instead of a new repository, with how this version of the source code will change, it 
might end up being quite different from the original game. But if it is not, this repository will get 
merged into the original game and this repository will get deleted.
<br /><br />
The game is not currently up.
